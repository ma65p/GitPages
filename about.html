<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="date" style="margin-bottom:40px"></div>
<p>This is the personal blog of Quyen Nguyen. He's a chemical engineer, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. He was born in Vietnam, came to the States during his teenage years, and currently working and living in Houston, TX area in oil and gas industry. With interest in graphic design and web development beside his engineering study, he made this site during his free time. It was a lot of fun, he reluctantly admits. Lastly, he does not address himself in third person in real life.</p>

<p>This blog has two categories &mdash; Notes and Articles. <a href="/">Articles</a> are longer and curated writings. Each will take some time to read. On the other hand, the <a href="/notes.html">Notes</a> section is more like a micro&ndash;blog that handles smaller posts</p>

<p>This site was developed from super light <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> blog engine, hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Posts are written originally in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. Math equations were written in LaTeX and rendered by <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>. Right click on those equations for some cool stuff.</p>

<p>On the graphic design side, this site designed using the <a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid System</a> and the wonderful, free <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo/">Museo</a> font</p>
