<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>This is the personal blog of Quyen Nguyen. He's a chemical engineer, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. He was born in Vietnam came to the States during my teenage years, and currently working and living in Houston, TX area. With interest in graphic design and web development beside his engineering study, this site was made during his free time for font. Lastly, he does not address himself in third person in real life.</p>

<p>This site was developed from <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> blog engine, hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Posts are written originally in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. If you see any math equations, they would have been written in LaTeX and rendered by <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>. Right click on those equations for some cool stuff.</p>

<p>For the graphic side, designed using the <a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid System</a> and the wonderful, and free <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo/">Museo</a> font</p>
