## Ownership - It's for Show
If we own something that costs, we make sure people know it, that we can afford it. In fact, even if we own something very inexpensive, we let people know it as well, because we were prudent. Bough a pair of nice boots for an awesome discount price? must brag.

Regardless of amount money spent, we boast about what we own. That's almost how ownership works. We seek approval in owning something.

## Let's Look at Ownership Differently

I have always wonder. There are many private arts collectors who owns millions of dollars worth of arts and yet they are private. Many pieces of arts with substantial value went missing until they turn up through donations from these collectors. Then they questions are, why would someone pay so much for an item and then hide it from the world (instead of boasting about them) or then donate them to a museum (which is a loss of invesment). 

It is possible that these folks do boast them in their own home to guests. Hide from the public so not to draw attentions of thiefs. And donated to a museum because it's a romantic and generous gesture that futher boost their image. 

A friend of mine recently purchased a drawing for over $1000. Arts have always puzzled me. I don't know how they are priced as I see no utility in them. It feels like buying a machine that does nothing. Though my friend was very pleased with her purchase, despite my confusion. She tells me about the artist, who painted it with a certain set of style. There was his inpiration. How she found it related to her personal life story. There was appreciation.

Owning something should be internal. The point isn't to make sure that other people appreciate and can tell what it is, but it's you who cares. Don't own because you hope that someone praise you.

Try it sometimes. Own something that means something to you. It has a connection with you in some way. You will seek no approval from no one. You beg no compliment. And when people disapprove the expense, you'll know that it's completely worth it to you.
