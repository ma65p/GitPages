I was listening to [Wait Wait Don't Tell Me](http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/) and an exchange between Sagal and Poundstone cought my attention


> SAGAL: Yeah, it's been proved. The researchers sent questions to thousands of subjects at random times of the day via a smartphone app. And they asked what they were doing and how they felt? **The people who answered at work reported being more miserable than everybody except for the people who answered, currently vomiting.**

> DICKINSON: So wait a minute. But they were people working at home or people just working?

> SAGAL: People just working. They said...

> DICKINSON: No, no, no. I - Peter, again, I...

> POUNDSTONE: No, no, no, no. Are you working right now?

> SAGAL: I am.

> POUNDSTONE: Is it a step away from vomiting?

> (LAUGHTER)

Of course Poundstone with her cruel skepticism continues to question whether the study was ligitimate. Honestly, I think the study might be true. It might be true that most people hate work. Or at least they say they do. 

I have noticed this crowd "yeah-it-sucks-for-me-too" mentality since college. We (including me) complains about classes, homework, and professors almost unnanimously and we praised none. But now in restrospect, I had the best time with the very things we said we despite. 

I remember noone says "I enjoyed that homework a lot" and I think some of us did. We really did, we studied for
