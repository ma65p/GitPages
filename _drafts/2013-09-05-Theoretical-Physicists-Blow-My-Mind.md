I have been long fascinated with physics and mathematics, from the simple scale of cool toys like [gyroscope](http://www.amazon.com/Tedco-Original-Gyroscope-Boxed/dp/B000JCQN3C/) and to now a more exciting toy like the [quantum levitation kit](http://www.quantumlevitation.com/demonsration-kits/). Sometimes physicists talk about things that are so abstract it hurts my head to think about like [the 10th dimension](), string theory, black holes, and quantum physics, but these topic are so fascinating, there are TV shows made about them (in a more digestiable format of course). 

I have stopped watching shows on Discovery channel and Science channel after I realized how oversimplified they were. 

Living in Houston, I ended up talking to a Physicists at NASA randomly in a coffee shop. He was drawing a semiconductor diagram with p-n nodes showing electron directions. 

"Hey, I knew that stuff, are you an electrical engineer?"
"Oh, no, I'm a physicist. But I see you recognized the p-n diagram"

The conversation went on as how he was working on a project to get ready for an experiment for the large Hardron Collider. I didn't understand much of his concepts to remember to this day. 

Interestingly, there was another "X-ray" Scientist from Oxford England that I met at a Hostel in Chicago. There was a research project at the Chicago ??? What??? and she gets to borrow their equipment.
