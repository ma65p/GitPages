I have grew up with SI unit system in Vietnam. Well, and the US has its own bizzare unit. My first encouter was when [NASA lost its Mars Orbital because of unit mix-ups](http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/unit-mixups.html#mco). NASA apparently passed `lb-f` to a program that takes `N`. 

And so now when there is an article about unit confusion, that story get mentioned. It was amusing at first how such scientist felt for such simply problem. Just mutiply the unit by some number and you got everything converted. What's the big deal. 

Now I work as an engineering and apparently that got so much more complicated. So complicated, there was research paper for it (look at this CPE article)
