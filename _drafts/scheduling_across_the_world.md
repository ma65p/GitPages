I have been taking a few [MOOCs](1) courses and especially when I we have a team set up with different timezone, it was very annoying to scedule a meeting. For instance, our team members are in Hongkong, USA, and Spain. Three different contenants so knowing "a good time to meet" is hard. 

## Don't ask for available time 
I have learned that it's not the best idea to ask for time when everyone is available for a meeting, especially meeting time depends on several members and when overlapping time between timezone is limited. It's better to map out a time slot where everyone might be awake and then offer those time slots as option for people to pick. This works better than asking what people avaiable time are and then trying to fit that. As organizer, it's a lot faster to say "here are our options, it's your job to choose, if it does not fit in your schedule, make adjustment or meet another time". 

## Why isn't there a tool already
This sounds like something pretty simple. Have a clock that compare between different timezone. Assume sleeping time such as from 12pm to 6am for everyone around the world and mark those out for all time zone. What's left is awake time. Pick the awake time between all three zone and vooola, meeting time. 

If there are no overlap between all timezone, someone must stay up. That can be easily be seen. Simply pick the time when most people are awake.
