I had a post on how to calculate the required relief rate for a [steam out scenario]({% post_url 2013-09-17-Steam-Out-Scenario %}). However, it was trickly to pick an overall heat transfer coefficient. So I doodle around to see what I can find. Of course, people have already talked about it [here](http://www.eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=155185) but arrived at no concencus. Here is my take. 

## Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient Equation
The configuration for heat transfer is
