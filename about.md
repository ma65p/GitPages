## Author
This is the personal blog of Olidin Theus. He's a chemical engineer, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. He was born in Vietnam, came to the States during his teenage years, and currently working and living in Houston, TX area in the oil and gas industry. 

With interest in graphic design and web development, he put this site together during his free time. He reluctantly admits that it was a lot of fun. He also knows some chemical engineer stuff, like valves, and pumps, and pressure relief devices. Yes, hard hats are nice and being safe is good. 

He also likes math, cookies, graphic shirts, rayban, fountain pen and calligraphy. He's new to twitter so send him cookies [@OlidinTheus](https://twitter.com/OlidinTheus). 

Lastly, even though Olidin talks to himeself when alone, he does not address himself in third person, nor is he addressed as Olidin in real life.
