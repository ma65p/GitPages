title: Scientific literature from the public library
---

My name is Tom Preston-Werner. I find that the hyphenated last name makes me sound distinguished and worth listening to. I grew up three decades ago in a small city in Iowa along the Mississippi, which means I shucked [a lot of corn and know exactly how many](google.com) mosquitos will land on your arm should you hold it still *for ten minutes at* dusk on the muggiest day of the summer. As an aspiring theoretical particle physicist, I worked my way through entire shelves of scientific literature from the public library, desperately wanting to understand the bewildering mathematics that littered the pages like so many leaves on the bottom of that morning's cup of green tea.

### I searched in vain
 
For instructors or classmates that could provide me with the insight necessary to comprehend the true meaning of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, but all I found were underpaid math teachers and disillusioned "students" in search of their next smoke break. After obsessing over US News' Best Colleges reports for months 

#### This is the 4th header

I finally chose and was accepted to Harvey Mudd, a tiny engineering school in California famous for assigning the greatest number of hours of homework per night. This sounded just perfect to me. Finally a place I could bring up the EPR Paradox and not be immediately stigmatized as "that science weirdo with the hilariously thick glasses and unfortunate hairdo."
