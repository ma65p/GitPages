## Are We Really Objective Even When We Tried?

When pursuing objectivitiy we tend to be fair. So we consider both sides of the argument. However, one typical pattern I noticed in myself when trying to be objective is well stated in [this statement](1):

> Often the student considers two opposed views and finds problems with both of them.  Then the student adopts a view that is different from those that have been critically discussed earlier in the paper and ends on a triumphal note without ever considering whether there are problems for their own view.

Aren't we arrogant beings? 

> Q: "Please consider opinions from these people."

> A: "No. They are all wrong, let me tell you why. Also here is my opinion, and I'm not going to disect my own opinion. Because it is right."
